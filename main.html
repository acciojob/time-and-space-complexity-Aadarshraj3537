    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task relative to the input size. It is crucial to design algorithms with efficient time complexity to ensure that programs can handle larger data sets effectively and perform well under various conditions.</p>

    <p>Space Complexity describes the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is an important consideration when designing algorithms, especially for large datasets. <b>Space Complexity</b> is often measured in terms of O(n), where n is the size of the input data, indicating that memory usage grows linearly with input size.</p>
